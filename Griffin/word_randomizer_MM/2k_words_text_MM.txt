~
Spittledrench the servant
and the old dog sleeper
alone between nurses and swans,
swimming and jungling 
against one another
while the boys among the willows
made the tigers jump out of their eyes
to roar on the rockery stones
and the groves were blue with sailors.
Gulls and the freight of their bodies
buried by the moon
and the ransom of the tide.
The warm gullet of the radiator
bristled and hissed,
hail chortled,
baskets weaved themselves
beneath the drenches of grass
rolling through all the fields.
I pounded through the birch floor
begging me for something,
some woman or child
or man to cut in half.
The dawdling drag,
the rustic angels of Spanish verbatim.
The last chord fades. 
The night is cold and fine.
His master's voice rasps 
through the groove's bare groves.
Obediently, in silence like the grave's
he sleeps there 
on the still-warm gramophone.
The bonsai sits jagged and soft
like a dim window,
dirty feet tossing in clean sheets.
And the silken sad uncertain rustling
of each purple curtain
drawing what might be a breath
from the world awake outside,
softly clawing its way around me.
That dream also timed me out, 
a lull 
in the boomeranging hubbub 
of the staggering city I'd just moved to. 
The oyster shells 
and mollusks 
ground up into the bricks 
seem to swell in the mornings too. 
The whole city seemed 
like a swollen tonsil 
or a cold-hardened nipple 
when the weather was strange. 
When the weather was worth discussing with strangers.
The rain can get bad.
It can really get nasty.
It douses the grapes,
sometimes knocks them off the vine,
crumples them up
on the ground with the pinecones
and the larva and the palm fronds
and the sand.
The healthy yellows veined with brown,
ochre and the lustful fist of wax.
This parchment was perfumed
with saltwater and silk.
The rain rotted through
and the trunk became
this deep thing
with a glazed weight
hung around it.
Loosey-goosey
gluey four limbs
whispers on the rocks.
He looks so divine to me
when he looks at you,
tossing a clotted mumble 
through the room,
bits of the chimney melting in my mouth.
The green train running, the slow slide
beginning in the bitter depth of mud
ten feet up the mountain.
In a pile of bottles and bones
sits the captain,
coughing up the haunch of a fork
and sneezing silver 
for a week and a half.
False oaths and curses 
are the deepest expression 
of human alienation; 
they mark the return of speaking subjects 
to an unintelligible autonomy
the autonomy of the figure 
receding back into the darkness,
a recession colored 
not by awareness
but by the dim cherry light
swinging in the rafters of the leaking ship.
Conceal and erase yourself
in the pulse of the rain
or the eye-sized crack in the chimney.
Smooth the oar with your tongue.
Dig me out with your fingers,
put yellow pills on my eyelids.
Scare children by crying about me
in public.

The moons got ground up.
The moons are no more. 
Sinking no more,
spinning no more,
touching themselves in back alleys
no more,
crossing the mouth of the river
with their edges steaming 
like bat balls
no more.
We slowly
and I mean slowly
rotted like chalk in the ocean.
The Latin ladies admired him
and under their smiles
dartled the dagger of despair.
Everything looks permanent until its secret is known.
I left her rigid among the flowers, 
her disdain perfected by death.
A girl slowly descended the line of steps.
A long thin wail.
A big boxy scream
peeled 
wallpaper and bark.
A cheap marble staircase
clunked alive against the heavy
rainfall sprouting up
in South Florida.
A slanted bowl of limes
heard the sound
and shrugged stationlessly
in the wet air.
A big rambling moment.
The beauty parlor is full of sailors,
dumping chits 
in the burlap crook of a snakehole,
washing and chasing away the women.
The stinking laundry was piled
up to the kids' chins on the window,
the ambulance turned over on its side,
tapioca curdling under the floorboards.
There is the height and weight of a sound,
its volume and brightness and tone,
and then there's the memory of it,
wrung through 
each current of pop
or zip or bang.
They remembered it like that,
the perfectly rounded tintinnabulation 
of a rubber ball,
poking its nose from the playground
through the window of the office
(maybe a dentist's office)
petering out 
against the roughness of the carpet,
the beigeness of it, 
the killing of it.
The killing done 
with a hairdryer in the alley,
the alley itself so, so wet.
In the groin of the natural doorway 
I crouched like a tailor
Sewing a shroud for a journey
By the light of the meat eating sun.
Nosing, like a hunger, into my wet shawl,
Ripping the suckling mill 
from the stream.
Dressed to die, 
the sensual strut begun,
With my red veins full of money,
In the final direction of the elementary town
I advance 
for as long as forever is.
A saint, Jerome, 
and grizzled robe, 
flawless in its dust.
In the first basement, 
standing alongside motors 
that looked enormous in the shadows, 
I felt very depressed. 
The effort needed to kill myself was superfluous now.
This pestilence of brick and edge
is loose upon my face.
But what's lovelier than the shape 
shifting transparence 
of like and as 
clear, undulant words?
~
As stupid as a motor is,
like rain but dry and hot.
Miscellaneous weed strands, 
stems, undone
firmament
to fishes
buttery pulp dangling
where the yellow feet of gulls dabble,
blades clap at the water,
ships churn to bubble
at night wildly black
brilliantly black and white 
through the movies, texture
of white snowy fur, 
burned bark curling and deaf,
the taxi's windshield, piano keys,
reflections that slid 
over the thick brass baton
that worked the elevator.
Tell-tale skin and teeth
flecking the sleepers
of four young brothers, 
trailed for miles 
along the lines.
The frigid little aqueducts 
of telephone lines, 
the silent lugging
above us all the time.
The styrofoam baked
off the side of the highway,
crusting and collapsing,
leaking water and color 
and no smell.
When Eccles turns to Harry 
bitterness cripples his laugh, 
turns his lips in tightly, 
so his small-jawed head 
shows its teeth like a skull.
I should start shouting his name
and clapping my hands,
dousing myself in sound,
but it has been raining all night
and the narrow creek has risen
is renting away 
is rushing along
over the mossy stones
is surging forward
with a sweet dirigible music
and I don't want to entangle it
with my own voice,
like a skull peeled out
through its mouth.
Penumbral umbrellas hulk and bulge
against the moon and the rain,
while you were in the shuddering house,
your moon red
and steady in the window.
Trees haze in the fog coming in,
late afternoon sun 
still catches the stones.
Dog's waiting to be fed 
by the empty sink,
I hear the river breathing.
That's all finally there is to think.
Now comes night 
with the moon and the stars.
In bracken and phlegm,
thin cotton wrapped around the fruit.
Orange and green and brown
smearing like lips 
in their cellophane.
Raise your little chisel
of a glass
coated in ice
and clock yourself
in the jaw
with a fat length of water.
Something screamed
from the fringes of the swamp
freckle dappled Death,
three arms in a trench coat
and both feet deep in the sand,
standing guard 
like a postcard of a golden retriever.
Here in her snooded garment 
and bare feet,
all ringleted in assonance and woodnotes,
the poet's dream stole over him 
like sunlight
and passed 
into the tenebrous thickets.
Peel the hot bouquet from the wall,
as thin as a paint chip,
lather your back
and your front
with shaved ice and vanilla.
I wrote with a deep groan 
of doom in my blood, 
bewildered and dumbstruck.
You who have thundered 
so cheerfully
would leave us so soon?
With a belch 
the color of chandeliers
and a wave over your shoulder?
You'll throw us down off the ledge
to the snap and gush of jaws?
Feel the tilting
when the yolk of salt
seethes up over the rocks
and hums in its rhythms,
and blows through itself to meet us.
Edging over that sly ravine,
your face erupting 
through the stale
teething of a cigarette.
~
The shivered shaft
rises from a shellheap
of plastic playthings
paper plates,
And the sheer shards
of shattered tumblers
They were not annealed
for the time needful.
The nude wallpaper
and the brute intelligence 
of the torn pipes.
The rusted triangle
in a straight curl.
The sheep
dragging dirt and grubs.
The impurity is drawn 
to the surface 
by a combination of gentle coaxing 
and violent torture 
the form is interrogated.
So the floor sags, 
as under the weight of a piano, 
or
a piano-legged girl 
as real night music takes over, 
pianos and vibes erecting clusters 
in the high 
brittle octaves 
and a clarinet wandering across 
like a crack on a pond. 
Saxes doing the same 
figure 8 over and over again.
Gargle and stutter and chime,
pissing music 
like you were sick,
chalking up the board,
greasing the keys
and threading the neck of the bottle,
pumping the brittle grey knob 
of railroad gin 
higher up
over the pine board
and the pig gut strings.
But all of that aside I think
that something else can change.
The mountain molts the ocean
and the divers dive again.
The pearl unwinds itself 
and the piston shatters.
My father, the surgeon,
turning the big red drums up
into harsh halogen
and gasses fizzling through
the holes of a mask.
Vulture! Whose wings are dull realities,
skirmishing down the subway stairs
with the rest,
tearing out long wreaths of butcher paper
from the hot typewriter.
Crouching to sniff up the junipers 
all shagged with lead and ice,
and swallow the rough spruce,
which can prick themselves 
distantly as the light house turns,
touching cold to its teeth
and shaking all along the wind.
Mostly, I want to be kind.
And nobody 
of course 
is kind, or mean,
for a simple reason.
And nobody gets out of it, 
having to swim 
through the fires to stay in
this world.
He goes through life bumping 
and grinding with a bull on top of him. 
He wasn't somebody 
who would leave 
any footprints 
on the sands of time, 
but there was something special about him. 
He had blood in his eyes, 
the face of a man 
who could do no wrong
gaunt and soft,
total lack of viciousness or wickedness 
or even sin 
caked into his face. 
He seemed like a man who could conquer 
and command anytime he wished to. 
Ray was mysterious as hell.
Caterwauling, clogging my throat
with the brittle swamps of poems,
the coarser pleasure 
of my boyish days,
and their glad animal movements 
all gone by.
Tripping through the sunburnt mirth
of my Aunt's face, 
the fat things hanging
from her eyes catching the sun
or the headlights from a big rig.
When trains go by
the frozen ground shivers
inwardly like an anvil.
The sound hits off 
the ten-masted thing
and the millipede in the bunk
and the softer belly in the blue bucket,
the stuttering grit as we lifted the shells,
stomped over to the gas station,
and ripped open what we'd bought.
Right from the beginning beautiful.
Also, the sunburn circling his collarbone
and the cupped whiteness inside his ear.
With means, motive, and a tire iron,
the slip-shod 
galosh man
running amok
through the back door
of Painter's Crematorium
past the runny mouth, the grate
to the sewer, 
and the rusted out fence,
tossed along the hairlip mouth 
of the shore,
yearning further into giving 
himself into the air, 
breath strained 
into song 
emptying the golden bell it comes from,
the pure source 
poured altogether out 
and away.
