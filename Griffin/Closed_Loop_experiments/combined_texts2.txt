I sing the body electric
The armies of those I love 
engirth me and I engirth them,
They will not let me off 
till I go with them, 
respond to them,
And discorrupt them, 
and charge them full 
with the charge of the soul
Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies 
conceal themselves
And if those who defile the living 
are as bad as they who defile the dead?
And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul?
And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?
The love of the body of man or woman balks account, 
the body itself balks account, 
That of the male is perfect, 
and that of the female is perfect 
The expression of the face balks account, 
But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face, 
It is in his limbs and joints also, 
it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists, 
It is in his walk, 
the carriage of his neck, 
the flex of his waist and knees, 
dress does not hide him, 
The strong sweet quality he has 
strikes through the cotton and broadcloth, 
To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, 
perhaps more, 
You linger to see his back, 
and the back of his neck and shoulder-side 
The sprawl and fulness of babes, 
the bosoms and heads of women, 
the folds of their dress, 
their style as we pass in the street, 
the contour of their shape downwards, 
The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, 
seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, 
or lies with his face up 
and rolls silently to and fro 
in the heave of the water, 
The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, 
the horseman in his saddle, 
Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances, 
The group of laborers seated at noon-time 
with their open dinner-kettles, 
and their wives waiting, 
The female soothing a child, 
the farmer's daughter in the garden or cow-yard, 
The young fellow hoeing corn, 
the sleigh-driver driving his six horses through the crowd, 
The wrestle of wrestlers, 
two apprentice-boys, quite grown, 
lusty, good-natured, native-born, 
out on the vacant lot at sun-down after work, 
The coats and caps thrown down, 
the embrace of love and resistance, 
The upper-hold and under-hold, 
the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes; 
The march of firemen in their own costumes, 
the play of masculine muscle 
through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps, 
The slow return from the fire, 
the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, 
and the listening on the alert, 
The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, 
the bent head, the curv'd neck and the counting; 
Such-like I love
I loosen myself, pass freely, 
am at the mother's breast with the little child, 
Swim with the swimmers, 
wrestle with wrestlers, 
march in line with the firemen, 
and pause, listen, count 
I knew a man, 
a common farmer, the father of five sons,
And in them the fathers of sons, 
and in them the fathers of sons 
This man was of wonderful vigor, 
calmness, beauty of person, 
The shape of his head, 
the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, 
the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, 
the richness and breadth of his manners, 
These I used to go and visit him to see, 
he was wise also, 
He was six feet tall, 
he was over eighty years old, 
his sons were massive, 
clean, 
bearded, 
tan-faced, 
handsome, 
They and his daughters loved him, 
all who saw him loved him, 
They did not love him by allowance, 
they loved him with personal love, 
He drank water only, 
the blood show'd like scarlet 
through the clear-brown skin of his face, 
He was a frequent gunner and fisher, 
he sail'd his boat himself, 
he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, 
he had fowling-pieces 
presented to him by men that loved him, 
When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons 
to hunt or fish, 
you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang, 
You would wish long and long to be with him, 
you would wish to sit by him 
in the boat 
that you and he might touch each other 
I have perceiv'd that to be with those I like is enough, 
To stop in company with the rest at evening 
is enough, 
---To be surrounded 
--by beautiful, curious, breathing, 
---laughing flesh is enough, 
To pass among them or touch any one, 
or rest my arm ever so lightly 
round his or her neck for a moment, 
what is this then? 
I do not ask any more delight, 
I swim in it as in a sea 
There is something in staying close to men and women 
and looking on them, 
and in the contact and odor of them, 
that pleases the soul well, 
All things please the soul, 
but these please the soul well 
This is the female form, 
A divine nimbus exhales 
from it from head to foot, 
It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction, 
I am drawn by its breath 
as if I were no more than 
a helpless vapor, 
all falls aside but myself and it, 
Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, 
and what was expected of heaven or fear'd of hell, 
are now consumed, 
Mad filaments, 
ungovernable shoots play out of it, 
the response likewise ungovernable, 
Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, 
negligent falling hands 
all diffused, 
mine too diffused, 
Ebb stung by the flow 
and flow stung by the ebb, 
love-flesh swelling 
and deliciously aching, 
Limitless limpid jets of love 
hot and enormous, 
quivering jelly 
of love, 
white-blow and delirious juice, 
Bridegroom night of love 
working surely and softly 
into the prostrate dawn, 
Undulating into the willing and yielding day, 
Lost in the cleave of the clasping 
and sweet-flesh'd day 
This the nucleus
after the child is born of woman, 
man is born of woman, 
This the bath of birth, 
this the merge of small and large, 
and the outlet again 
Be not ashamed women, 
your privilege encloses the rest, 
and is the exit of the rest, 
You are the gates of the body, 
and you are the gates of the soul 
The female contains all qualities and tempers them, 
She is in her place and moves with perfect balance, 
She is all things duly veil'd, 
she is both passive and active, 
She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, 
and sons as well as daughters 
As I see my soul reflected 
in Nature, 
As I see through a mist, 
one with inexpressible completeness, 
sanity, beauty, 
See the bent head and arms 
folded over the breast, 
the Female I see 
The male is not less the soul nor more, 
he too is in his place, 
He too is all qualities, 
he is action and power, 
The flush of the known universe is in him, 
Scorn becomes him well, 
and appetite and defiance become him well, 
The wildest largest passions, 
bliss that is utmost, 
sorrow that is utmost become him well, 
pride is for him, 
The full-spread pride of man is calming 
and excellent to the soul, 
Knowledge becomes him, 
he likes it always, 
he brings every thing to the test of himself, 
Whatever the survey, 
whatever the sea and the sail 
he strikes soundings at last only here, 
(Where else does he strike soundings except here?) 
The man's body is sacred and the woman's body is sacred, 
No matter who it is, 
it is sacred, 
is it the meanest one in the laborers' gang? 
Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants 
just landed on the wharf? 
Each belongs here or anywhere 
just as much as the well-off, 
just as much as you, 
Each has his or her place in the procession 
All is a procession, 
he universe is a procession 
with measured and perfect motion
Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant? 
Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, 
and he or she has no right to a sight? 
Do you think matter has cohered 
together from its diffuse float, 
and the soil is on the surface, 
and water runs and vegetation sprouts, 
For you only, and not for him and her? 
A man's body at auction, 
For before the war 
I often go to the slave-mart and watch the sale,
I help the auctioneer, 
the sloven does not half know his business 
Gentlemen look on this wonder, 
Whatever the bids of the bidders 
they cannot be high enough for it, 
For it the globe lay preparing 
quintillions of years
without one animal or plant, 
For it the revolving cycles 
truly and steadily roll'd 
In this head the all-baffling brain, 
In it and below it the makings of heroes 
Examine these limbs, 
red, black, or white, 
they are cunning in tendon and nerve, 
They shall be stript that you may see them 
Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition, 
Flakes of breast-muscle, 
pliant backbone and neck, 
flesh not flabby, 
good-sized arms and legs, 
And wonders within there yet 
Within there runs blood, 
The same old blood! 
the same red-running blood! 
There swells and jets a heart, 
there all passions, desires, reachings, aspirations, 
Do you think they are not there 
because they are not express'd 
in parlors and lecture-rooms?
This is not only one man, 
this the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns, 
In him the start of populous states and rich republics, 
Of him countless immortal lives 
with countless embodiments and enjoyments 
How do you know who shall come 
from the offspring of his offspring 
through the centuries? 
Who might you find 
you have come from yourself, 
if you could trace back through the centuries?
A woman's body at auction, 
She too is not only herself, 
she is the teeming mother of mothers, 
She is the bearer of them that shall grow 
and be mates to the mothers 
Have you ever loved the body of a woman? 
Have you ever loved the body of a man? 
Do you not see that these are exactly the same 
to all in all nations 
and times all over the earth? 
If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred, 
And the glory and sweet of a man 
is the token of manhood untainted, 
And in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, 
is more beautiful than the most beautiful face 
Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? 
or the fool that corrupted her own live body? 
For they do not conceal themselves, 
and cannot conceal themselves 
O my body! 
I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women, 
nor the likes of the parts of you, 
I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the soul, 
(and that they are the soul,) 
I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems, 
and that they are my poems, 
Man's, woman's, child's, youth's, 
wife's, husband's, mother's, father's, 
young man's, young woman's poems, 
Head, neck, hair, ears, 
drop and tympan of the ears, 
Eyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, eyebrows, 
and the waking or sleeping of the lids, 
Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, 
roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw-hinges, 
Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition, 
Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, 
throat, back of the neck, neck-slue, 
Strong shoulders, manly beard, 
scapula, hind-shoulders, 
and the ample side-round of the chest, 
Upper-arm, armpit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-sinews, arm-bones, 
Wrist and wrist-joints, 
hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, 
forefinger, finger-joints, finger-nails, 
Broad breast-front, curling hair of the breast, 
breast-bone, breast-side, 
Ribs, belly, backbone, 
joints of the backbone, 
Hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, 
inward and outward round, man-balls, man-root, 
Strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above, 
Leg fibres, knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under-leg, 
Ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the heel; 
All attitudes, all the shapeliness, 
all the belongings of my or your body 
or of any one's body, male or female, 
The lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, 
the bowels sweet and clean, 
The brain in its folds inside the skull-frame, 
Sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, 
sexuality, maternity, 
Womanhood, and all that is a woman, 
and the man that comes from woman, 
The womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, 
love-looks, love-perturbations and risings, 
The voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud, 
Food, drink, pulse, digestion, 
sweat, sleep, walking, swimming, 
Poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, 
embracing, arm-curving and tightening, 
The continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes, 
The skin, the sunburnt shade, freckles, hair, 
The curious sympathy one feels 
when feeling with the hand 
the naked meat of the body, 
The circling rivers the breath, 
and breathing it in and out, 
The beauty of the waist, 
and thence of the hips, 
and thence downward toward the knees, 
The thin red jellies within you or within me, 
the bones and the marrow in the bones, 
The exquisite realization of health; 
O I say these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but of the soul, 
O I say now these are the soul!
~
I've been having these awful dreams, 
each a little different,
though the core's the same-
we're walking in a field,
Wally and Arden and I, 
a stretch of grass
with a highway running beside it,
or a path in the woods 
that opens
onto a road 
Everything's fine,
then the dog sprints ahead of us,
excited; we're calling 
but he's racing down a scent 
and doesn't hear us,
and that's when he goes onto the highway 
I don't want to describe it
Sometimes it's brutal and over,
and others he's struck and takes off
so we don't know where he is or how bad 
This wakes me every night now, 
and I stay awake;
I'm afraid if I sleep I'll go back
into the dream 
It's been six months, almost exactly, 
since the doctor wrote
not even a real word
but an acronym, 
a vacant four-letter cipher
that draws meanings into itself,
reconstitutes the world
We tried to say it was just a word; 
we tried to admit it had power 
and thus to nullify it
by means of our acknowledgement
I know the current wisdom:
bright hope, 
the power of wishing you're well
He's just so tired, 
though nothing shows in any tests, 
Nothing, the doctor says, detectable;
the doctor doesn't hear what I do,
that trickling, steadily rising nothing
that makes him sleep all day,
vanish into fever's tranced afternoons,
and I swear sometimes
when I put my head to his chest
I can hear the virus 
humming like a refrigerator
Which is what makes me think
you can take your positive attitude
and go straight to hell
We don't have a future, we have a dog
Who is he?
Soul without speech,
sheer, tireless faith,
he is that-which-goes-forward,
black muzzle, black paws
scouting what's ahead;
he is where we'll be hit first,
he's the part of us 
that's going to get it
I'm hardly awake on our morning walk
-always just me and Arden now-
and sometimes I am still
in the thrall of the dream,
which is why, when he took a step onto Commercial
before I'd looked both ways,
I screamed his name and grabbed his collar
And there I was on my knees,
both arms around his neck
and nothing coming,
and when I looked into that bewildered face
I realized I didn't know what it was
I was shouting at,
I didn't know who I was trying to protect
I woke in the night
and thought, It was a dream,
nothing has torn the future apart,
we have not lived years in dread, 
it never happened,
I dreamed it all 
And then there was this sensation of terrific pressure
lifting, as if I were rising
in one of those old diving bells,
lightening, unburdening 
I didn't know how heavy my life had become-
so much fear,
so little knowledge 
It was like being young again, 
but I understood how light I was, 
how without encumbrance,-
and so I felt both young and awake,
which I never felt
when I was young 
The curtains moved
-it was still summer, all the windows open-
and I thought, I can move that easily
I thought my dream had lasted for years,
a decade, a dream can seem like that,
I thought, There's so much more time 
And then of course 
the truth came floating back to me
You know how children love to end stories 
they tell by saying, 
It was all a dream? 
Years ago,
when I taught kids to write,
I used to tell them 
this ending spoiled things,
explaining and dismissing
what had come before 
Now I know how wise they were, 
to prefer that gesture of closure,
their stories rounded not with a sleep
but a waking 
What other gift comes close to a reprieve?
This was the dream that Wally told me:
I was in the tunnel, he said,
and there really was a light at the end,
and a great being standing in the light 
His arms were full of people, 
men and women,
but his proportions were all just right-I mean
he was the size of you or me
And the people said, 
Come with us,
we're going dancing 
And they seemed so glad to be going, 
and so glad to have me join them, 
but I said,
I'm not ready yet 
I didn't know what to do,
when he finished,
except hold the relentless weight of him, 
I didn't know what to say except, 
It was a dream,
nothing's wrong now,
it was only a dream
Michael writes to tell me his dream:
I was helping Randy out of bed,
supporting him on one side
with another friend on the other,
and as we stood him up, 
he stepped out of the body I was holding 
and became a shining body, 
brilliant light held in the form 
I first knew him in
This is what I imagine will happen,
the spirit's release 
Michael, when we support our friends,
one of us on either side, 
our arms under the man or woman's arms,
what is it we're holding? 
Vessel, shadow, hurrying light? 
All those years
I made love to a man without thinking
how little his body had to do with me;
now, diminished, 
he's never been so plainly himself-
remote and unguarded,
an otherness I can't know the first thing about 
I said,
You need to drink more water 
or you're going to turn into an old dry leaf 
And he said,
Maybe I want to be an old leaf
In the dream Randy's leaping 
into the future, 
and still here; 
Michael's holding him
and releasing at once 
Just as Steve's holding Jerry, 
though he's already gone,
Marie holding John, gone, 
Maggie holding her John, gone, 
Carlos and Darren holding another Michael, 
gone,
and I'm holding Wally, who's going
Where isn't the question,
though we think it is;
we don't even know where the living are,
in this raddled and unraveling "here"
What is the body? 
Rain on a window,
a clear movement over whose gaze?
Husk, leaf, little boat of paper and wood 
to mark the speed of the stream?
Randy and Jerry, 
Michael and Wally and John: 
lucky we don't have to know what something is 
in order to hold it
I thought your illness a kind of solvent
dissolving the future a little at a time;
I didn't understand what's to come
was always just a glimmer
up ahead, veiled like the marsh
gone under its tidal sheet
of mildly rippling aluminum
What these salt distances were
is also where they're going:
from blankly silvered span
toward specificity: 
the curve of certain brave islands of grass,
temporary shoulder-wide rivers
where herons ply their twin trades
of study and desire 
I've seen two white emissaries 
unfold like heaven's linen, 
untouched, enormous, a fluid exhalation 
Early spring, too cold yet for green, 
too early for the tumble and wrack of last season
to be anything but promise,
but there in the air was white tulip,
marvel, triumph of all flowering, 
the soul lifted up, if we could still believe
in the soul, after so much diminishment 
Breath, from the unpromising waters,
up, across the pond and the two-lane highway,
pure purpose, over the dune,
gone Tomorrow's unreadable
as this shining acreage;
the future's nothing
but this moment's gleaming rim
Now the tide's begun
its clockwork turn, 
pouring, in the day's hourglass,
toward the other side of the world,
and our dependable marsh reappears
-emptied of that starched and angular grace
that spirited the ether, 
lessened, but here 
And our ongoingness,
what there'll be of us? 
Look, love, the lost world
rising from the waters again:
our continent, where it always was,
emerging from the half-light, 
unforgettable,
drenched, unchanged
Cold April and the neighbor girl
-our plumber's daughter-
comes up the wet street
from the harbor carrying,
in a nest she's made of her pink parka,
a loon 
It's so sick,
she says when I ask
Foolish kid,
does she think she can keep this emissary of air?
Is it trust or illness
that allows the head
-sleek tulip-
to bow on its bent stem
across her arm?
Look at the steady, quiet eye 
She is carrying
the bird back from indifference,
from the coast
of whatever rearrangement
the elements intend,
and the loon allows her
She is going to call the Center for Coastal Studies,
and will swaddle the bird
in her petal-bright coat
until they come
She cradles the wild form
Stubborn girl
Jimi and Tony
can't keep Dino, their cocker spaniel;
Tony's too sick,
the daily walks
more pressure than pleasure,
one more obligation
that can't be met
And though we already have a dog, 
Wally wants to adopt,
wants something small and golden 
to sleep next to him 
and lick his face
He's paralyzed now
from the waist down,
whatever's ruining him moving upward, 
and we don't know how much longer
he'll be able to pet a dog 
How many men want another attachment,
just as they're leaving the world?
Wally sits up nights and says, 
I'd like some lizards, 
a talking bird, some fish 
A little rat
So after I drive to Jimi and Tony's
in the Village 
and they meet me at the door 
and say, We can't go through with it, 
we can't give up our dog,
I drive to the shelter
-just to look-
and there is Beau: 
bounding and practically boundless,
one brass concatenation of tongue and tail,
unmediated energy,
too big, wild, perfect 
He not only licks Wally's face
but bathes every irreplaceable inch
of his head, 
and though Wally can no longer feed himself 
he can lift his hand, 
and bring it to rest on the rough gilt
flanks when they are,
for a moment, still
I have never seen a touch so deliberate
It isn't about grasping;
the hand itself seems almost blurred now,
softened, though tentative only
because so much will
must be summoned,
such attention brought to the work-
which is all he is now, 
this gesture toward the restless splendor,
the unruly, the golden,
the animal, the new
~
I saw the best minds of my generation 
destroyed by madness, 
starving hysterical naked,
dragging themselves 
through the negro streets at dawn 
looking for an angry fix,
angelheaded hipsters 
burning for the ancient heavenly connection 
to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,
who poverty and tatters 
and hollow-eyed and high 
sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness 
of cold-water flats 
floating across the tops of cities 
contemplating jazz,
who bared their brains to Heaven 
under the El and saw Mohammedan angels 
staggering on tenement roofs illuminated,
who passed through universities 
with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas 
and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war,
who were expelled from the academies for crazy 
& publishing obscene odes 
on the windows of the skull,
who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, 
burning their money in wastebaskets 
and listening to the Terror through the wall,
who got busted in their pubic beards 
returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York,
who ate fire in paint hotels 
or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, 
death, or purgatoried their torsos 
night after night
with dreams, 
with drugs, 
with waking nightmares, 
alcohol and cock and endless balls,
incomparable blind streets 
of shuddering cloud and lightning 
in the mind leaping toward poles of Canada & Paterson, 
illuminating all the motionless world of Time between,
Peyote solidities of halls, 
backyard green tree cemetery dawns, 
wine drunkenness over the rooftops, 
storefront boroughs of teahead joyride 
neon blinking traffic light, 
sun and moon and tree vibrations 
in the roaring winter dusks of Brooklyn, 
ashcan rantings 
and kind king light of mind,
who chained themselves to subways 
for the endless ride from Battery 
to holy Bronx on benzedrine 
until the noise of wheels and children brought them down 
shuddering mouth-wracked 
and battered bleak of brain 
all drained of brilliance 
in the drear light of Zoo,
who sank all night 
in submarine light of Bickford's 
floated out and sat through the stale beer afternoon 
in desolate Fugazzi's, 
listening to the crack of doom 
on the hydrogen jukebox,
who talked continuously seventy hours 
from park to pad to bar to Bellevue 
to museum to the Brooklyn Bridge,
a lost battalion of platonic conversationalists 
jumping down the stoops off fire escapes 
off windowsills 
off Empire State 
out of the moon,
yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering 
facts and memories and anecdotes 
and eyeball kicks 
and shocks of hospitals 
and jails and wars,
whole intellects disgorged in total recall 
for seven days and nights 
with brilliant eyes, 
meat for the Synagogue 
cast on the pavement,
who vanished into nowhere 
Zen New Jersey 
leaving a trail 
of ambiguous picture postcards 
of Atlantic City Hall,
suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone-grindings 
and migraines of China 
under junk-withdrawal 
in Newark's bleak furnished room,   
who wandered around and around at midnight 
in the railroad yard 
wondering where to go, 
and went, 
leaving no broken hearts,
who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars boxcars 
racketing through snow 
toward lonesome farms in grandfather night,
who studied Plotinus Poe St John of the Cross 
telepathy and bop kabbalah 
because the cosmos instinctively vibrated at their feet in Kansas,   
who loned it through the streets of Idaho 
seeking visionary indian angels 
who were visionary indian angels,
who thought they were only mad 
when Baltimore gleamed in supernatural ecstasy,
who jumped in limousines with the Chinaman of Oklahoma 
on the impulse of winter midnight 
streetlight smalltown rain,
who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston 
seeking jazz 
or sex or soup, 
and followed the brilliant Spaniard 
to converse about America and Eternity, 
a hopeless task, 
and so took ship to Africa,
who disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico 
leaving behind nothing but the shadow of dungarees 
and the lava and ash of poetry 
scattered in fireplace Chicago,
who reappeared on the West Coast investigating the FBI 
in beards and shorts with big pacifist eyes 
sexy in their dark skin 
passing out incomprehensible leaflets,
who burned cigarette holes in their arms 
protesting the narcotic 
tobacco haze of Capitalism,
who distributed Supercommunist pamphlets in Union Square 
weeping and undressing 
while the sirens of Los Alamos wailed them down, 
and wailed down Wall, 
and the Staten Island ferry also wailed,
who broke down crying in white gymnasiums 
naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons,
who bit detectives in the neck 
and shrieked with delight in policecars 
for committing no crime but their own 
wild cooking pederasty and intoxication,
who howled on their knees in the subway 
and were dragged off the roof 
waving genitals and manuscripts,
who let themselves be fucked in the ass 
by saintly motorcyclists, 
and screamed with joy,
who blew and were blown 
by those human seraphim, 
the sailors, caresses of Atlantic and Caribbean love,
who balled in the morning 
in the evenings in rosegardens 
and the grass of public parks and cemeteries 
scattering their semen freely 
to whomever come who may,
who hiccuped endlessly 
trying to giggle 
but wound up with a sob behind a partition 
in a Turkish Bath 
when the blond & naked angel 
came to pierce them with a sword,
who lost their loveboys 
to the three old shrews of fate 
the one eyed shrew of the heterosexual dollar 
the one eyed shrew that winks out of the womb 
and the one eyed shrew that does nothing but sit on her ass 
and snip the intellectual 
golden threads of the craftsman's loom,
who copulated ecstatic and insatiate 
with a bottle of beer 
a sweetheart 
a package of cigarettes 
a candle 
and fell off the bed, 
and continued along the floor 
and down the hall 
and ended fainting on the wall 
with a vision of ultimate cunt 
and come eluding 
the last gyzym of consciousness,
who sweetened 
the snatches 
of a million girls 
trembling in the sunset, 
and were red eyed in the morning but prepared 
to sweeten the snatch of the sunrise, 
flashing buttocks under barns 
and naked in the lake,
who went out whoring through Colorado 
in myriad stolen night-cars, 
NC, secret hero of these poems, 
cocksman and Adonis of Denver-joy 
to the memory of his innumerable lays of girls 
in empty lots & diner backyards, 
moviehouses' rickety rows, 
on mountaintops in caves 
or with gaunt waitresses 
in familiar roadside 
lonely petticoat upliftings 
& especially secret gas-station solipsisms 
of johns, & hometown alleys too,
who faded out in vast sordid movies, 
were shifted in dreams, 
woke on a sudden Manhattan, 
and picked themselves up out of basements 
hung-over with heartless Tokay and horrors of Third Avenue 
iron dreams 
& stumbled to unemployment offices,
who walked all night 
with their shoes full of blood 
on the snowbank docks 
waiting for a door in the East River to open 
to a room full of steam-heat and opium,
who created great suicidal dramas 
on the apartment cliff-banks of the Hudson 
under the wartime 
blue floodlight of the moon 
& their heads shall be crowned with laurel in oblivion,
who ate the lamb stew of the imagination 
or digested the crab 
at the muddy bottom of the rivers of Bowery,
who wept at the romance of the streets 
with their pushcarts full of onions 
and bad music,
who sat in boxes breathing in the darkness 
under the bridge, 
and rose up to build harpsichords in their lofts,
who coughed on the sixth floor of Harlem 
crowned with flame 
under the tubercular sky 
surrounded by orange crates of theology,
who scribbled all night 
rocking and rolling over lofty incantations 
which in the yellow morning were stanzas of gibberish,
who cooked rotten animals 
lung heart feet tail borsht & tortillas 
dreaming of the pure vegetable kingdom,
who plunged themselves under meat trucks 
looking for an egg,
who threw their watches off the roof 
to cast their ballot for Eternity 
outside of Time, 
& alarm clocks fell on their heads 
every day for the next decade,
who cut their wrists three times 
successively unsuccessfully, 
gave up and were forced to open antique stores 
where they thought they were growing old and cried,
who were burned alive 
in their innocent flannel suits 
on Madison Avenue amid blasts of leaden verse 
& the tanked-up clatter of the iron regiments of fashion 
& the nitroglycerine shrieks of the fairies 
of advertising 
& the mustard gas of sinister intelligent editors, 
or were run down 
by the drunken taxicabs of Absolute Reality,
who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge 
this actually happened 
and walked away unknown and forgotten 
into the ghostly daze of Chinatown 
soup alleyways & firetrucks, 
not even one free beer,
who sang out of their windows in despair, 
fell out of the subway window, 
jumped in the filthy Passaic, 
leaped on negroes, cried all over the street, 
danced on broken wineglasses barefoot 
smashed phonograph records of nostalgic European 1930s German jazz 
finished the whiskey 
and threw up groaning 
into the bloody toilet, 
moans in their ears 
and the blast of colossal steamwhistles,
who barreled down the highways of the past 
journeying to each other's hotrod-Golgotha 
jail-solitude watch 
or Birmingham jazz incarnation,
who drove crosscountry seventytwo hours 
to find out if I had a vision 
or you had a vision 
or he had a vision 
to find out Eternity,
who journeyed to Denver, 
who died in Denver, 
who came back to Denver & waited in vain, 
who watched over Denver & brooded 
& loned in Denver 
and finally went away to find out the Time, 
& now Denver is lonesome for her heroes,
who fell on their knees in hopeless cathedrals 
praying for each other's salvation 
and light and breasts, 
until the soul illuminated its hair for a second,
who crashed through their minds in jail 
waiting for impossible criminals 
with golden heads 
and the charm of reality in their hearts 
who sang sweet blues to Alcatraz,
who retired to Mexico to cultivate a habit, 
or Rocky Mount to tender Buddha 
or Tangiers to boys or Southern Pacific to the black locomotive 
or Harvard to Narcissus to Woodlawn 
to the daisychain or grave,
who demanded sanity trials 
accusing the radio of hypnotism 
& were left with their insanity 
& their hands 
& a hung jury,
who threw potato salad at CCNY lecturers on Dadaism 
and subsequently presented themselves 
on the granite steps of the madhouse 
with shaven heads 
and harlequin speech of suicide, 
demanding instantaneous lobotomy,
and who were given instead 
the concrete void of insulin 
Metrazol electricity 
hydrotherapy psychotherapy occupational therapy 
pingpong & amnesia,
who in humorless protest overturned only one symbolic pingpong table, 
resting briefly in catatonia,
returning years later truly bald 
except for a wig of blood, 
and tears and fingers, 
to the visible madman doom 
of the wards of the madtowns of the East,
Pilgrim State's Rockland's and Greystone's foetid halls, 
bickering with the echoes of the soul, 
rocking and rolling in the midnight solitude
-bench dolmen-realms of love, 
dream of life a nightmare, 
bodies turned to stone as heavy as the moon,
with mother finally ******, 
and the last fantastic book flung out of the tenement window, 
and the last door closed at 4 AM 
and the last telephone slammed at the wall in reply 
and the last furnished room emptied 
down to the last piece of mental furniture, 
a yellow paper rose twisted on a wire hanger 
in the closet, 
and even that imaginary, 
nothing but a hopeful little bit of hallucination-
ah, Carl, while you are not safe 
I am not safe, 
and now you're really in the total animal soup of time-
and who therefore ran through the icy streets obsessed 
with a sudden flash 
of the alchemy of the use of the ellipsis 
catalogue a variable measure 
and the vibrating plane,
who dreamt and made incarnate gaps in Time & Space 
through images juxtaposed, 
and trapped the archangel of the soul 
between 2 visual images 
and joined the elemental verbs 
and set the noun and dash of consciousness together 
jumping with sensation 
of Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus
to recreate the syntax and measure 
of poor human prose 
and stand before you speechless and intelligent 
and shaking with shame, 
rejected yet confessing out the soul 
to conform to the rhythm of thought 
in his naked and endless head,
the madman bum and angel beat 
in Time, unknown, 
yet putting down here what might be left to say 
in time come after death,
and rose reincarnate 
in the ghostly clothes of jazz 
in the goldhorn shadow of the band 
and blew the suffering of America's naked mind 
for love 
into an eli eli lamma lamma sabacthani saxophone cry 
that shivered the cities 
down to the last radio
with the absolute heart of the poem of life 
butchered out of their own bodies 
good to eat 
a thousand years
What sphinx of cement and aluminum 
bashed open their skulls 
and ate up their brains and imagination?

Down to the river! into the street!
Carl Solomon! I'm with you in Rockland
where you're madder than I am
I'm with you in Rockland
where you must feel very strange
I'm with you in Rockland
where you imitate the shade of my mother
I'm with you in Rockland
where you've murdered your twelve secretaries
I'm with you in Rockland
where you laugh at this invisible humor
I'm with you in Rockland
where we are great writers on the same dreadful typewriter
I'm with you in Rockland
where your condition has become serious 
and is reported on the radio
I'm with you in Rockland
where the faculties of the skull 
no longer admit the worms of the senses
I'm with you in Rockland
where you drink the tea of the breasts 
of the spinsters of Utica
I'm with you in Rockland
where you pun on the bodies of your nurses 
the harpies of the Bronx
I'm with you in Rockland
where you scream in a straightjacket 
that you're losing the game of the actual pingpong of the abyss
I'm with you in Rockland
where you bang on the catatonic piano 
the soul is innocent and immortal 
it should never die ungodly 
in an armed madhouse
I'm with you in Rockland
where fifty more shocks will never return 
your soul to its body 
again from its pilgrimage 
to a cross in the void
I'm with you in Rockland
where you accuse your doctors of insanity 
and plot the Hebrew socialist revolution 
against the fascist national Golgotha
I'm with you in Rockland
where you will split the heavens of Long Island 
and resurrect your living human Jesus 
from the superhuman tomb
I'm with you in Rockland
where there are twentyfive thousand mad comrades 
all together singing the final stanzas of the Internationale
I'm with you in Rockland
where we hug and kiss the United States 
under our bedsheets 
the United States that coughs all night 
and won't let us sleep
I'm with you in Rockland
where we wake up electrified 
out of the coma 
by our own souls' airplanes 
roaring over the roof 
they've come to drop angelic bombs 
the hospital illuminates itself    
imaginary walls collapse    
O skinny legions run outside    
O starry-spangled shock of mercy 
the eternal war is here    
O victory forget your underwear we're free
I'm with you in Rockland
in my dreams you walk dripping from a sea-journey 
on the highway across America 
in tears 
to the door of my cottage in the Western night
~
Off Havana, 
the ocean is green this morning
of my birth 
The conchers clean their knives 
on leather straps 
and watch the sky 
while three couples who have been dancing 
on the deck of a ship
in the harbor, 
the old harbor of the fifties, 
kiss each other's cheeks and call it a night
On a green sofa five dresses wait to be fitted 
The seamstress kneeling 
at Mother's feet
has no idea I am about to be born 
Mother pats her stomach 
which is flat as the lace mats 
on the dressmaker's table 
She thinks
I'm playing in my room 
But as usual, she's wrong
I'm about to be born in a park in Havana 
Oh, this is important, 
everything in the dressmaker's house
is furred like a cat 
And Havana leans right up
against the windows 
In the park, the air is chocolate, 
the sweet breath of a man
smoking an expensive cigar 
The grass is drinkable, 
dazzling, white 
In a moment
I'll get up from a bench, 
lured by a flock of pigeons, 
lazily sipping the same syrupy music 
through a straw
Mother is so ignorant, 
she thinks I'm rolled like a ball of yarn 
under the bed 
What does she know of how I got trapped in my life?
She thinks it's all behind her, 
the bloody sheets, 
the mirror in the ceiling
where I opened such a sudden furious blue, 
her eyes bruised shut like mine 
The pigeon's eyes are orange, 
unblinking, a doll's 
Mother always said
I wanted to touch everything 
because I was a child 
But I was younger than that
I was so young 
I thought whatever I wanted, the world wanted too 
Workers in the fields 
wanted the glint of sun on their machetes
Sugarcane came naturally sweet, 
you had only to lick the earth where it grew
The music I heard each night 
outside my window 
lived in the mouth of a bird 
I was so young
I thought it was easy 
as walking into the ocean 
which always had room for my body 
So when I held out my hands
I expected the pigeon to float between them
like a blossom, 
dusting my fingers 
with the manna of its wings 
But the world is wily, 
and doesn't want to be held for long, 
which is why
as my hands reached out, 
workers lay down their machetes 
and left the fields, 
which is why a prostitute in a little calle of Havana 
dreamed the world was a peach 
and flicked open a knife 
And Mother, startled, 
shook out a dress 
with big peonies 
splashed like dirt
across the front, 
as if she had fallen
chasing after me in the rain 
But what could I do?
I was about to be born, 
I was about to have my hair 
combed into the new music
everyone was singing 
The dressmaker sang it, 
her mouth filled with pins 
The butcher sang it 
and wiped blood on his apron 
Mother sang it 
and thought her body was leaving her body 
And when I tried
I was so young the music beat right through me, 
which is how the pigeon got away
The song the world sings 
day after day
isn't made of feathers, 
and the song a bird pours itself into 
is tough as a branch
growing with the singer 
and the singer's delight
~
From narrow provinces   
of fish and bread and tea,   
home of the long tides
where the bay leaves the sea   
twice a day 
and takes the herrings long rides,
where if the river enters or retreats
in a wall of brown foam   
depends on if it meets   
the bay coming in,
the bay not at home;
where, silted red,
sometimes the sun sets   
facing a red sea,
and others, veins the flats' lavender, 
rich mud
in burning rivulets;
on red, gravelly roads,
down rows of sugar maples,   
past clapboard farmhouses   
and neat, clapboard churches,   
bleached, ridged as clamshells,   
past twin silver birches,
through late afternoon
a bus journeys west,
the windshield flashing pink,   
pink glancing off of metal,   
brushing the dented flank of blue, 
beat-up enamel;
down hollows, up rises,   
and waits, patient,
while a lone traveller gives kisses 
and embraces
to seven relatives
and a collie supervises
Goodbye to the elms,   
to the farm, to the dog   
The bus starts 
The light grows richer; 
the fog,   
shifting, salty, thin,
comes closing in
Its cold, round crystals form 
and slide and settle   
in the white hens' feathers,   
in gray glazed cabbages,   
on the cabbage roses
and lupins like apostles;
the sweet peas cling
to their wet white string   
on the whitewashed fences;   
bumblebees creep
inside the foxgloves,
and evening commences
One stop at Bass River   
Then the Economies-
Lower, Middle, Upper;   
Five Islands, Five Houses,
where a woman shakes a tablecloth out 
after supper
A pale flickering 
Gone   
The Tantramar marshes   
and the smell of salt hay   
An iron bridge trembles   
and a loose plank rattles   
but doesn't give way
On the left, 
a red light swims through the dark:   
a ship's port lantern   
Two rubber boots show,   
illuminated, solemn   
A dog gives one bark
A woman climbs in
with two market bags,   
brisk, freckled, elderly   
A grand night 
Yes, sir,   
all the way to Boston   
She regards us amicably
Moonlight as we enter the New Brunswick woods,   
hairy, scratchy, splintery;   
moonlight and mist
caught in them 
like lamb's wool on bushes 
in a pasture
The passengers lie back   
Snores Some long sighs   
A dreamy divagation begins in the night,
a gentle, auditory,
slow hallucination
In the creakings and noises,   
an old conversation
-not concerning us,
but recognizable, somewhere,   
back in the bus:
Grandparents' voices
uninterruptedly
talking, in Eternity:
names being mentioned,   
things cleared up finally;   
what he said, what she said,   
who got pensioned;
deaths, deaths and sicknesses;   
the year he remarried;
the year (something) happened   
She died in childbirth
That was the son lost
when the schooner foundered
He took to drink 
Yes
She went to the bad
When Amos began to pray   
even in the store 
and finally the family had to put him away
Yes  
that peculiar affirmative "Yes "
A sharp, indrawn breath,   
half groan, half acceptance,   
that means 
Life's like that   
We know it (also death)
Talking the way they talked   
in the old featherbed,   
peacefully, on and on,
dim lamplight in the hall,   
down in the kitchen, 
the dog tucked in her shawl
Now, it's all right now   
even to fall asleep
just as on all those nights   
-Suddenly the bus driver stops with a jolt,
turns off his lights
A moose has come 
out of the impenetrable wood
and stands there, 
looms, rather,   
in the middle of the road
It approaches; 
it sniffs at the bus's hot hood
Towering, antlerless,   
high as a church,
homely as a house
(or, safe as houses)
A man's voice assures us   
"Perfectly harmless"
Some of the passengers exclaim in whispers,   
childishly, softly,
"Sure are big creatures"   
"It's awful plain"   
"Look! It's a she!"
Taking her time,
she looks the bus over,   
grand, otherworldly   
Why, why do we feel   
(we all feel) 
this sweet sensation of joy?
"Curious creatures,"
says our quiet driver,   
rolling his r's
"Look at that, would you"   
Then he shifts gears
For a moment longer,
by craning backward,   
the moose can be seen
on the moonlit macadam;   
then there's a dim smell of moose, 
an acrid smell of gasoline
~
From Manhattan, 
a glittering shambles
of enthrallments and futilities, 
of leapers in leotards, 
scissoring vortices blurred,
this spring evening, 
by the punto in aria of hybrid pear trees in bloom 
(no troublesome fruit to follow) 
my own eyes are drawn to-
childless spinner of metaphor, 
in touch by way of switchboard and satellite, 
for the last time ever, 
with my cousin Muriel:
mother of four, 
worn down by arthritis,
her kidneys wasting, 
alone in a hospital somewhere in California: 
in that worn voice,
the redhead's sassy timbre eroded from it,
while the unspeakable stirs like a stone,
a strange half-absence 
and a tone of weakness
(Wordsworth's discharged soldier comes to mind)
as she inquires, fatigued past irony, 
"How's your work going?" 
As for what was hers-
nursing-home steam-table clamor, 
scummed soup fat, 
scrubbed tubers, 
bones, knives, viscera, cooking odors 
lived with till they live with you, 
a settlement in the olfactory tissue-
well, it's my function to imagine scenes, 
try for connections
as I'm trying now: 
a grope for words,
the numb, all but immobilized trajectory 
to where my cousin, whom I've seen just once
since she went there to live, 
lies dying:
part of the long-drawn larger movement
that lured the Reverend Charles Wadsworth to San Francisco, 
followed in imagination
from the cupola of the shuttered homestead
in Amherst 
where a childless recluse,
on a spring evening a century ago, 
ad (so to speak) 1886, 
would cease to breathe
the air of rural Protestant New England-
an atmosphere 
and a condition 
which by stages, wagon trains, tent meetings,
the Revival, infused the hinterland
my cousin Muriel and I both hailed from:
a farmhouse childhood, kerosene-lit,
tatting-and-mahogany genteel 
"You were the smart one," 
she'd later say
Arrant I no doubt was; 
as for imagining scenes, 
it must be she'd forgotten
the melodramas she once improvised 
above the dolls' tea-table: 
"For the pity's sake!
How could you get us all in such a fix?
Well, I s'pose we'll just have to make the best of it"-
the whole trajectory of being female, 
while I played the dullard,
presaged 
She bloomed, knew how to flirt,
acquired admirers 
I didn't 
In what I now recall as a last teen-age heart-to-heart,
I'm saying I don't plan on getting married
"Not ever?" 
"Not ever"-
then, craven, 
"Oh, I'd like to be engaged" 
Which is what she would have been, 
by then, 
to Dorwin Voss,
whom I'd been sweet on in fifth grade 
(last painless crush before the crash of puberty)-
blue-eyed, black-haired, good-looking Dorwin,
who'd later walk out on her and their kids,
moving on again, 
part of the larger exodus
from the evangel-haunted prairie hinterland
Some stayed; 
the more intemperate of us headed east-
a Village basement, 
uptown lunch hours, 
vertiginous delusions of autonomy, 
the bar crowd; 
waiting for some well-heeled dullard of a male 
to deign to phone, 
or for a stumbling-drunk, 
two-timing spouse's key 
to turn the small-hour dark into another fracas-
others for California: 
the lettuce fields,
Knott's Berry Farm, 
the studios; palms, slums, sprinklers, 
canyon landslides,
fuchsia hedges hung with hummingbirds,
the condominium's kempt squalor: 
whatever Charles Wadsworth, out there, foresaw
as consolation for anyone at all-
attached, estranged, or merely marking time-
little is left, these days, these times, to say
when the unspeakable stirs like a stone
Pulled threads, 
the shared fabric of a summer memory: 
the state fair campground,
pump water, 
morning light through tent flaps,
the promenade among the booths: 
blue-ribbon zinnias and baby beeves, 
the cooled marvel of a cow, 
life size, carved out of butter;
a gypsy congeries without a shadow on it
but the domed torpor of the capitol
ballooning, ill at ease, egregious
souvenir of pomp among the cornfields;
kewpie-doll lowlife along the midway,
the bleachers after dark 
where, sick with mirth, 
under the wanton stars,
for the ineptitude of clowns, 
we soared in arabesques of phosphorus, 
and saw-
O dread and wonder, 
O initiating taste of ecstasy-
a man shot from a cannon
Too young then to know 
how much we knew already of experience, 
how little of its wider paradigm, 
enthralled by that punto in aria of sheer excitement, 
we who are neither leaf nor bole-
O hybrid pear tree, 
cloned fruitless blossomer!-
suspend, uprooted from the hinterland,
this last gray filament 
across a continent
where the unspeakable stirs 
like a stone
~
It so happens I am sick of being a man
And it happens that I walk into tailorshops and movie houses
dried up, waterproof, 
like a swan made of felt
steering my way in a water of wombs and ashes
The smell of barbershops makes me break into hoarse sobs
The only thing I want is to lie still 
like stones or wool
The only thing I want is to see no more stores, no gardens,
no more goods, no spectacles, no elevators
It so happens I am sick of my feet and my nails
and my hair and my shadow
It so happens I am sick of being a man
Still it would be marvelous to terrify a law clerk 
with a cut lily,
or kill a nun with a blow on the ear
It would be great
to go through the streets with a green knife
letting out yells until I died of the cold
I don't want to go on being a root in the dark,
insecure, stretched out, shivering with sleep,
going on down, into the moist guts of the earth,
taking in and thinking, eating every day
I don't want so much misery
I don't want to go on as a root and a tomb,
alone under the ground, 
a warehouse with corpses,
half frozen, dying of grief
That's why Monday, 
when it sees me coming
with my convict face, 
blazes up like gasoline,
and it howls on its way like a wounded wheel,
and leaves tracks full of warm blood 
leading toward the night
And it pushes me into certain corners, 
into some moist houses,
into hospitals where the bones fly out the window,
into shoeshops that smell like vinegar,
and certain streets hideous as cracks in the skin
There are sulphur-colored birds, 
and hideous intestines
hanging over the doors of houses that I hate,
and there are false teeth forgotten in a coffeepot,
there are mirrors that ought to have wept 
from shame and terror,
there are umbrellas everywhere, 
and venoms, and umbilical cords
I stroll along serenely, 
with my eyes, my shoes, my rage, 
forgetting everything,
I walk by, 
going through office buildings and orthopedic shops,
and courtyards 
with washing hanging from the line:
underwear, towels and shirts 
from which slow dirty tears are falling
~
I see the boys of summer in their ruin
Lay the gold tithings barren,
Setting no store by harvest, 
freeze the soils;
There in their heat the winter floods
Of frozen loves they fetch their girls,
And drown the cargoed apples in their tides
These boys of light are curdlers in their folly,
Sour the boiling honey;
The jacks of frost they finger in the hives;
There in the sun the frigid threads
Of doubt and dark they feed their nerves;
The signal moon is zero in their voids
I see the summer children in their mothers
Split up the brawned womb's weathers,
Divide the night and day with fairy thumbs;
There in the deep 
with quartered shades of sun and moon 
they paint their dams
As sunlight paints the shelling of their heads
I see that from these boys shall men of nothing
Stature by seedy shifting,
Or lame the air with leaping from its heats;
There from their hearts 
the dogdayed pulse of love and light bursts in their throats
O see the pulse of summer in the ice
But seasons must be challenged or they totter
Into a chiming quarter
Where, punctual as death, we ring the stars;
There, in his night, the black-tongued bells
The sleepy man of winter pulls,
Nor blows back moon-and-midnight as she blows
We are the dark derniers 
let us summon Death from a summer woman,
A muscling life from lovers in their cramp
From the fair dead who flush the sea
The bright-eyed worm on Davy's lamp
And from the planted womb the man of straw
We summer boys in this four-winded spinning,
Green of the seaweeds' iron,
Hold up the noisy sea 
and drop her birds,
Pick the world's ball of wave and froth
To choke the deserts with her tides,
And comb the county gardens for a wreath
In spring we cross our foreheads with the holly,
Heigh ho the blood and berry,
And nail the merry squires to the trees;
Here love's damp muscle dries and dies
Here break a kiss in no love's quarry,
O see the poles of promise in the boys
I see you boys of summer in your ruin
Man in his maggot's barren
And boys are full and foreign to the pouch
I am the man your father was
We are the sons of flint and pitch
O see the poles are kissing as they cross

I am as far as the deepest sky between clouds
and you are as far as the deepest root and wound, 
and I am as far as a train at evening, 
as far as a whistle you can't hear or remember 
You are as far as an unimagined animal 
who, frightened by everything, never appears 
I am as far as cicadas and locusts
and you are as far as the cleanest arrow 
that has sewn the wind to the light 
on the birch trees 
I am as far as the sleep of rivers 
that stains the deepest sky between clouds, 
you are as far as invention, 
and I am as far as memory
You are as far as a red-marbled stream 
where children cut their feet on the stones 
and cry out 
And I am as far as their happy mothers, 
bleaching new linen on the grass 
and singing, "You are as far as another life," 
"As far as another life are you"
And I am as far as an infinite alphabet 
made from yellow stars and ice, 
and you are as far as the nails of the dead man, 
as far as a sailor can see at midnight 
when he's drunk and the moon is an empty cup, 
and I am as far as invention 
and you are as far as memory
I am as far as the corners of a room 
where no one has ever spoken, 
as far as the four lost corners of the earth 
And you are as far as the voices of the dumb, 
as the broken limbs of saints and soldiers, 
as the scarlet wing of the suicidal blackbird, 
I am farther and farther away from you 
And you are as far as a horse without a rider can run in six years, 
two months and five days
I am as far as that rider, 
who rubs his eyes with his blistered hands, 
who watches a ghost don his jacket and boots 
and now stands naked in the road
As far as the space between word and word, 
as the heavy sleep of the perfectly loved 
and the sirens of wars no one living can remember, 
as far as this room, 
where no words have been spoken, 
you are as far as invention, 
and I am as far as memory

As if the lid stayed put on the marmalade
As if you could get the last sip of champagne
out of the bottom of the fluted glass
As if we weren't all dying, 
as if we all weren't going to die some time, 
as if we knew for certain when, or how 
As if the baseball scores made sense to the toddler 
As if the dance steps mattered, 
or there's a point where they don't 
For instance wheelchair 
Heart flutter
Oxygen bottle mounted on the septuagenarian's back
at the state ballroom competitions-
that's Manny, still pumping the mambo 
with his delicious slip of an instructor, 
hip hip hooray 
Mambo, for instance, if done right, 
gives you a chance to rest: one beat in four
One chance in four, one chance in ten, a hundred, 
as if we could understand what that means 
Hooray 
Keep pumping 
As if you could keep the lid on a secret
once the symptoms start to make sense 
A second instance, a respite A third 
Always that hope
If we could just scrape that last little bit out, 
if only it wouldn't bottom out
before they can decode the message
sent to the cells 
Of course it matters when, 
even though (because?) we live in mystery 
For instance Beauty Love Honor 
As if we didn't like secrets 
Point where it hurts 
Of course we'll tell
